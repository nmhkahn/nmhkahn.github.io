<b>Research&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> My goal is to develop powerful generative AI (Gen AI) solutions applicable across various domains, creating a strong Gen AI+X framework. I am currently focused on creating specialized methodologies to adapt large‐scale foundational Gen AI models in fields such as media, art, health‐care, manufacturing, and logistics, although my scope is not limited to these areas. I am also interested in exploring the societal implications of Gen AIs and developing ways to mitigate potential negative impacts that may arise from the development of Gen AI.


<b>Previosuly&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> I was an AI researcher at [NAVER WEBTOON](https://webtoonscorp.com/en/). At NAVER WEBTOON, I researched Gen AI solutions for cartoon creators and artists aimed at enhancing their productivity, allowing them to focus more on creativity side (e.g. [Cartooner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09555), [DreamStyler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06933)). I also developed fun and creative products with Gen AI (e.g. [WebtoonMe](https://webtoon.github.io/WebtoonMe)). Additionally, I worked on mitigating the negative societal impacts of Gen AI, particularly by developing methods to prevent copyright infringement by these technologies to protect the intellectual properties of professional artists (e.g. [Impasto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19254)).

Before joining NAVER WEBTOON, I received my Ph.D. from Ajou University in 2021, advised by [Kyung-Ah Sohn](https://sites.google.com/site/kasohn/home), where I primarily focused on image enhancement and restoration (e.g. [CARN](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08664), [CutBlur](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00448)). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Media from Ajou University in 2016.
